<h2>Why I want to become programmer?</h2>
<p>Computer programming is one of the most flexible tools that we can have at our disposal.
     Not only can we learn to do things that are pretty amazing, but we can also, sometimes,
      manage to perform the impossible. Anyone that uses a computer, a smartphone, even a
       key that remotely unlocks our car door is using some form of computer programming and
        our life already depends on programming to a certain extent. For the vast majority of 
        people in today’s digital world, their lives are already being run and ruled by
         software so why not learn to program and get involved, create our own programs to do
          what we want them to do?</p>

    <li>Make Your Life Easier</li>
    <li>An Amazing Career</li>
